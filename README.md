# Machine Learning Classifier Model Evaluation

## Overview

This project involves evaluating the performance of various machine learning classifiers on a given dataset. Each classifier has been trained and tested, and their accuracy scores have been recorded for comparison.

## Classifier Performance

Below are the accuracy scores achieved by each classifier:

- Decision Tree Classifier: 0.95452
- Random Forest Classifier: 0.972
- AdaBoost Classifier: 0.97316
- SGD Classifier: 0.94892
- Support Vector Machines: 0.94836
- Nearest Neighbors: 0.85336
- KNeighbors Classifier: 0.95368
- Neural network models: 0.96364
- Gradient Boosting Classifier: 0.97344
- Naive Bayes: 0.90444

## Conclusion

From the evaluation results, it can be observed that the Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the highest accuracy score of 0.97344, closely followed by the AdaBoost Classifier with a score of 0.97316. These classifiers seem to be well-suited for the given dataset. However, further analysis, including considering other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model performance.
